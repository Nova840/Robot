#This is the file where you tell motors which inputs should affect them.
#Note that capitalization and spacing do not matter for this file, and any line starting with # will be ignored.
#There are multiple types of motors you can use. The types are L298N, DRV8833, SERVO_1, SERVO_2, PCA9685_1, and PCA9685_2.

#If we input L298N into the first element, it will take 3 GPIO numbers after it. These are the EN, GPIO1, and GPIO2 on the L298N.
#The GPIO1 and GPIO2 can be flipped, and the motor will spin in the opposite direction.
#If you are not using the EN pin, you can just input -1. This will mean you don't get speed control, just make sure you put the jumper on the L298N's EN pin.

#If you are using the DRV8833, you would make it the same as the L298N but without supplying the EN pin.
#So instead of "L298N, EN, GPIO1, GPIO2", you would write "DRV8833, GPIO1, GPIO2"

#SHUTDOWN can be used as the first element to shut down the raspberry pi.

#You then specify inputs by supplying them in pairs of input: multiplier.
#You can use Xbox controller or keyboard/mouse input, when using an Xbox controller you put JOY_ before the input, and for keyboard/mouse it's KEY_.

#You can find out the keyboard/mouse button by using the keyboard_mouse_test.sh script. You press a button and it will tell you what the next part of the input is.
#For example, A on keyboard gives you 'A', and the up arrow gives you KEY.UP. So the inputs would be KEY_'A' and KEY_KEY.UP.
# KEY_',' is not available because it's what separates elements.

#For Xbox controller input, the possible inputs are:
#A, B, X, Y, GUIDE, LEFTX, LEFTY, RIGHTX, RIGHTY, DPADUP, DPADDOWN, DPADLEFT, DPADRIGHT, LEFTTHUMBSTICK, RIGHTTHUMBSTICK, LEFTBUMPER, RIGHTBUMPER, LEFTTRIGGER, RIGHTTRIGGER
#For example, for A on the controller you would type JOY_A, and for the X axis of the left stick you would type JOY_LEFTX.

#A physical switch can be connected to the GPIO pins and controlled with SWT followed by the GPIO number, for example, SWT_21.
#The switch should short the GPIO pin with one of the ground pins.

#You then multiply the input by a number, as a percent in decimal form. So you'd type 1 to have 100% speed, 0.5 to have 50% speed, etc.
#You can multiply by negative numbers to make the motor spin backwards.
#Using multiple inputs will make them add together, so for example, pushing a button with a multiplier of 1 and another button with -1 would cancel out and the motor would stop.
#With that in mind, you could make forward and backward buttons, or fast and slow buttons.
#The inputs can add up to be more than 100% speed, but the motor will not atually go above 100% (or below -100%).


#Remove the # before the line and restart the program to test out these examples. Make sure the motors are connected to the correct pins for each example.


#Example 1: (Type, EN, GPIO1, GPIO2, Input, Multiplier)
#L298N, 16, 20, 21, KEY_KEY.UP, 1
#This will move the motor connected to GPIO 16, 20, and 21 when the UP arrow key is pressed.

#Example 2: (Type, EN, GPIO1, GPIO2, Input, Multiplier, Input, Multiplier, Input, Multiplier, Input, Multiplier)
#L298N, 16, 20, 21, KEY_KEY.UP, 1, KEY_KEY.DOWN, -1, JOY_LEFTY, 1, KEY_'W', 0.5, KEY_'S', -0.5, JOY_RIGHTY, 0.5
#Same as Example 1, but with more inputs.
#The DOWN arrow spins it in the opposite direction, and you can also control it with the left analog stick on the controller.
#Using W and S instead of UP and DOWN will make the motor spin at half speed, as will using the right stick instead of the left stick.


#If you wanted to use the DRV8833 instead of the L298N in Example 1, this is what it would look like:


#Example 3: (Type, GPIO1, GPIO2, Input, Multiplier)
#DRV8833, 20, 21, KEY_KEY.UP, 1
#Same as Example 1, but using the DRV8833 instead of the L298N. Note that it doesn't use the EN pin.


#Servo motors are also supported, you type SERVO_1 instead of MOTOR for the first element.
#Servos take 4 numbers after it: the GPIO number, the resting position, the minimum position, and the maximum position.
#The positions are the PWM duty cycle, as a percentage from 0 to 100. Some servos are different, but good numbers to try at first are between 5 and 10.
#The resting position is where the servo will be when no input is pressed.
#If you try to set the servo's position too low / high, the servo won't attempt to move at all, so it needs a min and max to tell it the range it can move.
#If the servo isn't moving in one direction, it might be the min / max value.

#Input for servos works the same way as for motors, but instead of a speed multiplier it's a change in position.
#So if the servo is at position 7 and you want it to move to 5 when you push B on the controller, you would use "JOY_B, -2"


#Example 1: (Type, GPIO, Resting Position, Min Position, Max Position, Input, Position Change, Input, Position Change)
#SERVO_1, 21, 7, 5, 9, KEY_KEY.LEFT, 2, KEY_KEY.RIGHT, -2
#This will move the servo back and forth when you push the left and right arrow keys.

#Example 2: (Type, GPIO, Resting Position, Min Position, Max Position, Input, Position Change, Input, Position Change)
#SERVO_1, 21, 5, 5, 9, KEY_KEY.UP, 2, KEY_KEY.DOWN, 2
#Inputs will be added together, so in this case, the resting position is 7, and if both up and down are pressed, the servo will be at position 9.

#Example 3: (Type, GPIO, Resting Position, Min Position, Max Position, Input, Position Change, Input, Position Change)
#SERVO_1, 21, 5, 5, 7, KEY_KEY.UP, 2, KEY_KEY.DOWN, 2
#Like Example 2, but instead of going farther when both of them are pushed, it goes to the same position (7) when either or both of them are pushed.
#This is because it's hitting the Max Position and can't go any farther.


#You can also change the type to SERVO_2 and it will behave like a normal MOTOR but with limits on how far it can spin.
#Since it no longer has a resting position, it now becomes the starting position that it will be in then the script starts up.
#Instead of input multipliers like a normal MOTOR, it's now the position change per second. It's the same amount it spins for SERVO_1 every second.


#Example: (Type, GPIO, Starting Position, Min Position, Max Position, Input, Position Change / Time, Input, Position Change / Time)
#SERVO_2, 21, 7, 5, 9, KEY_KEY.LEFT, 1, KEY_KEY.RIGHT, -1
#This will move the servo back and forth when you push the left and right arrow keys.


#You will notice the servo can be a bit jittery when standing still. This is because the PWM signal is not very precise with the GPIO pins.
#You can get a PCA9685 Servo Driver to improve this. To use it, just replace the word "SERVO" with "PCA9685", and instead of the GPIO pin you put the channel.


#Example: (Type, Channel, Resting Position, Min Position, Max Position, Input, Position Change, Input, Position Change)
#PCA9685_1, 0, 7, 5, 9, KEY_KEY.LEFT, 2, KEY_KEY.RIGHT, -2
#Same as SERVO_1 Example 1 but using the PCA9685 Servo Driver. You can use it just like SERVO_1 and SERVO_2.


#SHUTDOWN only takes the inputs as arguments, nothing else.


#Example: (Type, Input, Multiplier)
#SHUTDOWN, KEY_KEY.F1, 1
#This will shut down the raspberry pi when the F1 key is pressed. The shut down function is called when the input is greater than or equal to 1.

#Example: (Type, Input, Multiplier)
#SHUTDOWN, KEY_KEY.F1, 0.5, KEY_KEY.F2, 0.5
#This will shut down the raspberry pi when the F1 and F2 keys are pressed at the same time. the two 0.5's are added together to get 1.


#Using SWT as input will allow you to connect a physical switch to the raspberry pi, just connect one side to a GPIO pin and the other to ground.


#Example: (Type, Input, Multiplier)
#SHUTDOWN, SWT_21, 1
#This will shut down the raspberry pi when a physical switch is pressed that is connected to GPIO 21 and ground.
